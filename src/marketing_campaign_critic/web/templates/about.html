            <p>Developed by somebody who doesnt know shit about marketing but decided to make something closely related to it for a Hackathon in NYC. He will not be keeping this updated unless he finds a pot of gold, probably wont do frontend ever again in his life. Anyways, go try this website out, Thanks :')</p>
